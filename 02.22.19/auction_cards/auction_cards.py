#You are managing an auction with 650 bidders, each bidder is given a bidding card with their number printed on it. However, the numbers 0,1,6,8,9 all look the same upside-down or right-side up.

#For example, 6 looks like 9 flipped upside-down. And “69” looks like “96” when held upside down.

#Write an algorithm to determine if given a number if it’s possible that the card is displayed upside-down.

#The cards do not have leading 0s for numbers with fewer than 3 digits, so they are not printed “01” for “1” or “071” for “71”
